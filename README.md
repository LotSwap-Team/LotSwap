# LotSwap

Welcome to the LotSwap repo. As our project evolves we will continue to upload our project files. Currently we want to publicize our token contract to show that we are using the audited open zeppelin contract. 

Also we want to show our vault contract which currently holds the Liquidity Providing token for the LotSwap market on pancakeswap. The vault also holds the remaining supply of token that is released based on the schedule listed in the comments of Vault.sol

As we launch our mainnet bridge we will also release the code once it is audited and approved.
